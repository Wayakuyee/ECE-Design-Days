Arduino code for Solar Tracker Challenge (Group 26)
 
Solar Tracker Challenge:

Many poor rural communities don’t have traditional electrical distribution because of its high distribution and maintenance costs. Paradoxically, the world’s poorest households are more likely to have a mobile phone than a toilet. Your task is to create a simple, effective, and low-cost solar tracker to provide sustainable and affordable solar charging for mobile devices. Your team will be given an Arduino, a Tetrix mechatronics kit with servo motors, and some light sensors. With these supplies, you will create a solar tracker that must follow a light source (the “sun”) as it arcs through the sky in an equatorial rural village to position a solar panel for the best exposure to sunlight. The goal is to maximize the amount of solar energy captured from the solar panel.
